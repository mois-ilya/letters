**Summary: Working with Dates and Time in Client-Server Applications**

Handling dates and time in programming is intricate, and the key to managing this complexity lies in the distinction between absolute and relative time. Absolute time, tied to UTC, is consistent globally, while relative time is zone-specific. Properly differentiating between the two is essential for databases, with systems like PostgreSQL offering types with and without time zone data. At the API level, one can represent absolute time using the ISO 8601 format inclusive of the time zone, while relative time is depicted sans time zone considerations. Real-world applications, such as Booking.com, stress the significance of understanding and implementing these time distinctions. Proper date and time management helps developers avoid common timezone pitfalls, enabling a streamlined focus on core application logic.
