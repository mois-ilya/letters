# Working with Dates and Time in Client-Server Applications
## Introduction (Summary)
This article delves into the complexities associated with handling dates and time in programming, emphasizing the importance of clarity in code. The author suggests focusing on explicit details in code rather than verbal or written agreements among developers. The main emphasis is on the distinction between absolute and relative time. Absolute time remains consistent across the world and is linked to Greenwich Mean Time (UTC), while relative time depends on a specific time zone.

## What's the Deal with Data? (Summary)
When it comes to dates and time in programming and databases, it's crucial to differentiate between absolute and relative time. In the PostgreSQL database, there are types to represent time with time zone information (timestamptz) and without it (timestamp without time zone, date, time). At the API level, absolute time can be represented in the ISO 8601 format with a time zone, whereas relative time is presented without considering the time zone. In GraphQL, it's essential to clearly define data types for absolute and relative time, ensuring clarity and stability when working with dates and time.

## Choosing the Right Time Storage Type Using Booking.com as an Example (Summary)
Booking.com highlights the importance of differentiating between absolute and relative time based on business logic. While the server typically sets absolute time, users influence relative time. By segregating dates and times in bookings, systems can more flexibly adapt to various business scenarios, such as cost recalculations or changes in accommodation conditions.

## Why is All This Essential? (Summary)
By adhering to the discussed principles, developers on both the client and server sides can bypass many common timezone-related issues. This is achieved through a data storage architecture that handles time zones and by leveraging standard library tools of most programming languages and database management systems. As a result, developers can focus on core application logic, reducing errors and complexities related to dates and times.
